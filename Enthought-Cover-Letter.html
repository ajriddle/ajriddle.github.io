		<p>Dear Sir/Madam,</p>
		<p>I am writing to inquire about the Python technical trainer/developer job posted on the Enthought website and to express my interest in adding to your effort to disseminate the greatest programming language to the masses.</p>
		<p>With a background in both scientific programming in Python and teaching, I believe I have the ideal mix of programming knowledge and teaching experience to help inform new users in the scientific community/data science field of the capabilities and advantages of Python. Through my astronomy research, first at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and then at the University of Texas at Austin, I taught myself how to program in Python and developed those skills to perform most of my research activities. Some highlights where I used Python in my research include:
		<ul>
			<li>Creating a user interface to query a database of hundreds of stars based on several search parameters and return a sorted list to the user based on other command line options.</li>
			<li>Combining with shell scripts to perform real-time image processing on data taken from the 0.8-m telescope at McDonald Observatory.</li>
			<li>Developing my own Markov Chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to perform an analysis on observational data from Keck Observatory to find the best 9-parameter fit to the data.</li>
			<li>Developing an implementation of the two-dimensional cross-correlation (TODCOR) algorithm to measure the radial velocities of stars in binary star systems.</li>
		</ul></p>
		<p>I have 7 semesters as a teaching assistant for lower and upper level undergraduate astronomy classes., where I enjoyed working with students to teach them new things. I have demonstrated excellent oral and written communication through presentation of 5 seminars at UT Austin and 3 successful proposals for telescope time at the LCOGT network of telescopes and at McDonald Observatory. I have also presented several posters at meetings of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) and the Cool Stars conference. My presentation skills were recognized at the 227th meeting of the AAS in 2016, where I won the Chambliss Award for my poster presentation on my graduate research.</p>
		<p>The first Python distribution I used was the EPD, so when I decided I wanted to get a job as a programmer using primarily Python, Enthought was one of the first places I looked. I learned many things during my time in graduate school, but the two biggest lessons were that programming is my true passion and that I love to teach.</p>
		<p>I welcome the opportunity to meet with you to discuss how I can help Enthought disseminate the greatest programming language out there.</p>
		<p>Sincerely,</p>
		<p>Andrew Riddle</p>
