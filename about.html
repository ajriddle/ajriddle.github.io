		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Before working as a data scientist, I spent several years as a grad student at the University of Texas at Austin, studying astronomy. In particular, I studied eclipsing binary stars, star systems that have two stars that pass in front of each other as viewed from Earth. During my time as a grad student, I developed my skills in physics, statistics, and computer programming, doing the vast majority of my work in Python. I also learned how to communicate effectively to both technical and non-technical audiences, receiving an award for my presentation of my research at the meeting of the American Astronomical Society meeting in Kissimmee,FL in 2016.</p>
		
		<p>As interesting as astronomy research was, it didn't engage me in a way that was fulfilling. I yearned to work more with people and on projects that have a positive impact on people's lives, even if that impact is relatively small. This lead me to move out of astronomy and into data science, where I could make use of my statistical and programming background to help people.</p>
