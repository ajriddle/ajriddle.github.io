			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>I am a data scientist with a natural curiosity about how the world works and won't stop working on a problem until I've figured it out. Hard work is vital, but being able to relax and have fun is just as important. My experience as an astronomy researcher gave me the tools to perform complex data analysis and modeling, but just as importantly, the ability to communicate these ideas to people in and outside of the field. I seek out projects with a tangible human impact, even if it's just making a routine task a little easier..</p>

            <h3>Astronomy Research</h3>
			<p>The main project I worked on as a grad student was the study of low-mass (<0.8 times the Sun's mass) eclipsing binaries, star systems with two stars that pass in front of (eclipse) each other as viewed from Earth. The observed properties of these low mass stars don't quite line up with what we expect from stellar models. My project was to attempt to find the cause of these discrepancies and correct for it to learn something about stellar physics. One of the main sources of my data was the <a href="http://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/koa/public/koa.php">Keck Observatory Archive</a>, where I obtained hundreds of unpublished stellar spectra of binary star systems. I made use of my own Python implementation of the <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1994ApJ...420..806Z">TODCOR algorithm</a> (a two-dimensional cross-correlation) to derive radial velocities for each star. I then wrote a MCMC orbit fitter in Python to solve for the best-fit orbital solution based on the derived radial velocities. Sample results for one system, MG1-2062466, can be seen below. Follow the link to my Github page at the bottom of this site to see the code for the MCMC orbit fitter and the TODCOR algorithm.</p>
